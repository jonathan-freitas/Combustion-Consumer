# Combustion Consumer 
A simple application in Swift, that consumes an external API (based on my personal Apiary) and lists all workers.

### Overview :fire:
This project helped me on building the [Share Module](), in a simple but effective way. And also on requesting items from a external API using [Alamofire]().

### Frameworks :satellite:
- [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift)
Using RxSwift, binding the list of workers is a lot much easier and keeps the data up-to-date.
- [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)
Alamofire is a great help to build requests in Swift, and it helps in a way that feels native to the platform.
- [AlamofireImage](https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireImage)
This helps a lot in downloading an image, especially if the image is bigger than you expected. You can even set a placeholder for the view while the download is progressing.
- [Share](https://github.com/fabricioeus/ShareInstagram)
I used this library as a founding to build my own, it's versality and usefulness helped me on building the worker that is now.
